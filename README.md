# Bong and Boom
 
Bong and Boom was made for Major jam 3: Retro. The jam's theme was retro (duh), the limitation was that the game had to have a maximum reosultion of 96 x 96 pixels, and it lasted a week. 

In Bong and Boom, you play as a circle in a small room. Enemy squares will come in from the wall in waves to try and attack you. To move, you have to fling with the mouse and to kill the squares you can shoot with space. However, you only have a limited amount of bullets. Bullets will occasionally spawn randomly. If you get hit you die. The objective of the game is to get as many points as you can. 

This was inspired by Pong with its black and white graphics and no music (totally wasn't being lazy).

Overall I got #13 out of 56 entries.
